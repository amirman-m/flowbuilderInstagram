# Project Description

**Social Media Automation Platform** is a SaaS tool that empowers non-technical users to automate customer-service interactions on social platforms (starting with Instagram). Using a visual drag-and-drop builder, users define automation **flows** composed of Nodes such as Triggers, AI processors, and Actions. Each flow can be executed in testing mode or deployed to run 24/7 in production.

## Target Users
1. E-commerce brands needing quick comment/DM replies.
2. Social media managers handling high message volume.
3. Agencies automating client accounts.

## Key Features
* **Visual Flow Builder** – No-code interface to create automation logic.
* **LLM & RAG Nodes** – Generate context-aware answers from knowledge bases.
* **Multi-platform** – Start with Instagram, roadmap includes WhatsApp, Facebook, X.
* **Realtime Execution Logs** – Observe each node’s input/output live.
* **Extensible Node SDK** – Developers can add custom nodes via Python.
* **Secure Token Storage** – OAuth & encrypted tokens per workspace.

## Business Goals
* Reduce customer response time < 1 min.
* Provide 80% automation coverage of common queries.
* Offer tiered pricing based on monthly executions.
